## Getting Started

The beginning stages of building Flight Tracker began with creating user stories and wireframes. This was an extremely useful took to reference throughout the process. Feel free to **[take a look](https://trello.com/b/1HcjNsOO/fight-planner)!

Once you've taken a look at the wireframes I encourage you to **[visit](https://flight-planner.herokuapp.com/) the finished application and see how I brought the idea to life!

## Unresolved Issues

There are a few items on my agenda that still need to be addressed. When a user clicks the "submit" button to submit their flight plan they are redirected to the homepage however the screen is faded out. Once the user clicks anywhere on the screen the screen fades back in. I intend to resolve this to enhance my UI design.

## Future Enhancements

There are quite a few features I plan on adding to my application. To name a few I will be adding an account's page for the user to compete upon creating an account. As a pilot you need to have certain certifications to fly and I want to include this a user's account page. I would also like to create an Administrator app. On the top of my list however is adding a feature to Google Maps where the user can draw a line from one point of destination to another so they can map out their route.
