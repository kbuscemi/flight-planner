# Flight Tracker

The idea to build Flight Tracker came to me during a conversation I was havig one day with my brother. My brother was explaining to me how he has on average 5 flights a day, every day through April and that he was not only having difficulties keeping track of every flight but there was no simple way to submit his flight plans to be reviewed before takeoff. And that's when the idea came to me. I wanted to build an app where pilots can submit their upcoming flights to be reviewed. I wanted the application to be very detailed yet simple for pilots to be able to submit all the information needed for their flight plan to be granted clearance. With that in mind, Flight Tracker came to life.

## Getting Started

The beginning stages of building Flight Tracker began with creating user stories and wireframes. This was an extremely useful tool that I continuously referenced throughout the process. Feel free to [take a look](https://trello.com/b/1HcjNsOO/fight-planner)!

Once you've taken a look at the wireframes I encourage you to [visit](https://flight-planner.herokuapp.com/) the finished application and see how I brought the idea to life!

## Unresolved Issues

There are a few items on my agenda that still need to be addressed. When a user clicks the "submit" button to submit their flight plan they are redirected to the homepage however the screen is faded out. Once the user clicks anywhere on the screen the screen fades back in. I intend to resolve this to enhance user experience.

## Future Enhancements

There are quite a few features I plan on adding to my application. To name a few I will be adding an account's page for the user to complete upon creating an account. As a pilot you need to have certain certifications to fly and I want to include this on the account page. I would also like to create an administrator app. On the top of my list however is adding a feature to Google Maps where the user can draw a line from one point of destination to another so they can map out their route.
